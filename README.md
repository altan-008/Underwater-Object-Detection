# Underwater Object Detection

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting and analyzing underwater objects using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The code was developed in Python and leverages common data science and deep learning libraries.

## 📁 File Structure

- `underwater object.py.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- Image preprocessing for underwater environments
- Object detection/classification model
- Visualization of predictions
- Evaluation metrics and performance plots

## 🔧 Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies may include:

Python 3.x

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

opencv-python

tensorflow or pytorch (depending on your framework)

jupyter

🧠 Usage
To run the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook "underwater object.py.ipynb"
Ensure you have the dataset in the expected directory or modify the path in the notebook accordingly.

📊 Results
Sample output and model performance are displayed in the notebook, including accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

📌 Notes
Make sure your GPU/CPU is properly configured for deep learning if applicable.
